### The Cat App
[by Lukas Carvajal](http://lukascarvajal.com)

An iOS application that makes use of a tab bar controller with three tabs. It also implements UIPickerView, UITextView, UIImageView, UIWebView. The first tab allows a user to type in the name of a cat. The app then displays google images in the UIWebView by manipulating a url. The second tab allows users to "identify" different cats by selecting a "cat type" from a UIPickerView and displaying the cat in an UIImageView. The last tab just shows a couple of jokes with UILabel.
